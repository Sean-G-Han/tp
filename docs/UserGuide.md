# WealthVault User Guide

WealthVault is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, WealthVault can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your application.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar wealthvault.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `addc n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the application.

   * `delc 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   - `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   - `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addc n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addc n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/POLICY_TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Policy A` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/POLICY_TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Policy B`, `t/Policy C t/Policy D` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
  </box>

**Notes about the fields:**<br>

- `-` (a single dash) can be used should it not be possible to supply a valid `PHONE_NUMBER`,
  `EMAIL` or `ADDRESS` at the point the details are entered. However, `-` cannot be used for `NAME`.
- Anything more than `-` (a single dash) could be interpreted differently (e.g. `--` is not valid for `PHONE_NUMBER`).

- `NAME` can only be up to 150 characters long, and cannot contain invalid symbols (e.g. \\).
- `NAME` has every first letter capitalised by default, to protect against identifying the same name with different
  casing as different names.

- `PHONE_NUMBER` should be of the format +[international code] [number] (e.g. +41 123; the `+` is optional).
  If no international code is provided, the phone number will start with +65.
- `PHONE_NUMBER`'s international code should not include whitespace.
- `PHONE_NUMBER`'s international code and number should be separated by a whitespace.
- `PHONE_NUMBER`'s international code should be 1-3 digits long, and the number should be 3-13 digits long.

- `EMAIL` should be of the format [local-part]@[domain]. Standard domain names like gmail.com are definitely fine.
- `EMAIL` should not contain unnecessary whitespace.
- The local part of `EMAIL` should be alphanumeric, but it cannot start or end with any special characters.
  Nonetheless, it can contain +\_.-
- The domain name of `EMAIL` must end with a domain label at least 2 characters long. Every domain label
  must start and end with alphanumeric characters, must consist of alphanumeric characters, and can be
  separated only by hyphens (if any).

- `ADDRESS` should not be more than 150 characters long.

- `POLICY_TAG` should not be more than 150 characters long. It should not contain invalid symbols (e.g. \).

- `INDEX` should be obtained from the displayed client list. For example, if `findall` is used on a list of 10 clients
  such that there is only 1 client in the list eventually displayed, only `delc 1` is a valid command to delete a client.

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

### Listing all clients : `list`

Shows a list of all clients in WealthVault.

**Format**: `list`

### Editing contact information : `edit`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

### Updating contact information : `update`

**Format**: `update INDEX [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

- Updates the client at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Name and tags cannot be modified using this command. Use the `edit`, `addp` and `delp` commands instead.

**Examples**:

- `update 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Updates the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

Potential Errors:

Errors           | Reason                                                                             |Fixes
-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------
"Field is empty  | This error is thrown when no indexes are supplied to the `priority` command        | To fix this error, simply supply a proper index
"Index is not a non-zero unsigned integer" | This error is thrown when a non-zero unsigned integer is supplied like `a` or `-1` | To fix this error, simply supply a non-zero unsigned integer
"The client with the given index does not exist!"| This error is thrown when the specified index is bigger than the size of the list | To fix this error, input an index equal to or smaller than the size of the list

### Sorting by priority: `sortpriority`

Sorts all clients in the list by priority, with prioritized clients appearing at the top.

**Format**: `sortpriority`

* Clients with the "Priority" tag will be moved to the top of the list
* The relative order of clients within each group (prioritized and non-prioritized) is preserved
* This command affects only the display order and does not modify any client data

**Example**:
* `sortpriority` rearranges the list to show prioritized clients first, followed by non-prioritized clients.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

WealthVault data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, WealthVault will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the WealthVault to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous WealthVault home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
